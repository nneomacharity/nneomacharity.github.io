									<p>From a personal standpoint, I have a strong inclination towards exploring various passions. Currently, I am particularly interested in conducting research on Virtual Reality (VR) with a special focus on haptics technology.

										Virtual Reality involves creating simulated environments that can be similar to or entirely different from the real world. It typically requires the use of a VR headset to immerse the user in a digital realm. Haptics technology, on the other hand, focuses on replicating the sense of touch through vibrations, forces, or other tactile feedback.
										
										To pursue my research interests in VR with haptics, I have embarked on a learning journey. I am actively acquiring skills in software tools like Blender and Unity. Blender is an impressive open-source 3D creation suite that enables the creation and manipulation of 3D models, animations, and visual effects. Unity, on the other hand, is a widely used game engine renowned for building interactive experiences, including VR applications.
										
										By familiarizing myself with Blender and Unity, I am equipping myself with the necessary tools to generate 3D assets and develop immersive VR environments. These skills will facilitate the integration of haptic feedback, enabling users to experience a heightened sense of touch within virtual environments.
										
										Furthermore, I am also taking courses on Web3, an emerging concept in internet technology. Web3 represents the next generation of the internet, leveraging blockchain and decentralized protocols to create a more secure, private, and user-centric online ecosystem. Exploring Web3 allows me to understand how this evolving technology can intersect with VR and haptics, potentially opening up new avenues for innovative research and applications.
										
										In summary, my intention to delve into VR research with a specific emphasis on haptics technology reflects my passion for exploring immersive experiences. Through learning Blender and Unity, I am acquiring the fundamental skills to create 3D assets and develop VR applications. Additionally, my exploration of Web3 offers valuable insights into the convergence of decentralized technologies and immersive experiences. These multidisciplinary pursuits position me to contribute to the exciting field of virtual reality research.
